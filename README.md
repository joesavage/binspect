# Binspect

A Mac application by [Joe Savage](http://www.reinterpretcast.com/) for visualising binary data - inspired by the work of [Aldo Cortesi](http://corte.si/posts/visualisation/binvis/index.html), and to a lesser extent Greg Conti and Christopher Domas.

Currently the application is relatively bare-bones to its purpose, simply providing visualisation options via two space-filling curves and three colouring modes. The (slightly over-commented) code is licensed as described in the 'LICENSE' file, under the MIT license.

The application was developed on a Late 2013 Retina Macbook Pro running Yosemite. While I would hope it runs somewhat sensibly in other environments, I can make no guarantees to this effect.
